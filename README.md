# Colemak DHJK

Colemak DHJK is a sensible variation of the Colemak DH layout which makes two key changes.

1. The original Colemak DH layout places J key on the top row and K key on the bottom row. While this is completely fine for regular use, when you are a vim user, this feels very counter intuitive. It makes much more sense to have J key (which is line down key in vim) on the bottom row; and to have K key (which is the line up key in vim) on the top row. Colemak DHJK does exactly this by swapping the J and K keys on Colemak DH layout

2. Most developers favour snake_case_variable_names over kebab-case-variable-names. Because of thes, `_` character is much more utilized than `-` character. So Colemak DHJK swapps these two key invocations. `_` will be triggered on a normal keypress and `-` will be triggered when `Shift` + `_` is pressed. This has the added benifit of `+` key and `-` key being on the same `Shift` + layer.
